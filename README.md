# RT2_Assignments

## Assignment 1 part 1: 3rd assignment documentation
In this assignment, we documented our third RT1 assignment in Doxygen format. We used Doxygen to create documentation for the assignment code.

## Assignment 1 part 2: Jupyter notebook
Create a Jupyter notebook to interact with the simulation of the 3rdassignment 

## Assignment 2: Statistical analysis on the first assignment
This study aims to perform a statistical analysis of two distinct robot
control mechanisms: the first one devised during [RT1 Assignment 1](https://github.com/ParinazRmp/First-Assignment-Research-Track-1.git), and the
second one, an alternative approach provided by the [Professor](https://github.com/CarmineD8/python_simulator/tree/rt2), serving as a
comparative benchmark.
